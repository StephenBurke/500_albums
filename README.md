# 500 Greatest Albums of All Time

End of year project for my 44-155 Intro to Data Mining class. I web mined two seperate 500 greatest album lists of all time and graphed on a bar plot the difference between number of albums awarded per year, for each list. I used a list from The Rolling Stones and a list from New Musical Express. The graph shows more information easier than me typing it all out, so I'll leave it at that.
